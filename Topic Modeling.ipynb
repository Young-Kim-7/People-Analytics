I know it is an unfortunate situation and a lot of the aspects that make the internship as strong as it is can't be replicated remotely. \\n\\nI think working in the research department though I'd hoped to get to work on a challenging project that challenged my economic skills. But, I also understand this is hard for managers to provide in the WFH environment because it is harder to get over that learning curve remotely.  \",\n"," 'As I stated earlier, there are a lot of distractions when working from home. However, I have been able to overcome these distractions with time and focus on assignments. ',\n"," 'As mentioned above, it can feel a bit isolating. I also feel like my managers are busy people so I often am waiting for higher-ups to get back to me. ',\n"," \"As stated above, technology-wise it does present some challenges and has taken up a bit more time than expected. In addition, being at home with my family can be difficult as my work day isn't always entirely uninterrupted, so some days it can be more challenging to be productive than others. Overall though, I feel like these are typical struggles when working from home, and I experienced this with school as well. \",\n"," \"Even though I'm extremely grateful that the internship is still happening, the virtual experience feels less immersive. I don't get to see the buildings, the offices, or even people's body languages. Similar to school, any experience that's online versus being in person makes the opportunity feel less inclusive.\",\n"," \"Everyone is in a conference call all day and being virtual is kind of isolating, so I'm hesitant to reach out and ask questions. I'm also always anxious over the fact that I have no idea what people are thinking about me or my performance because I can't tell over email, chat, or Skype calls. Without that existing rapport, they don't know me and I don't know them, so I have no sense of gauging anything without being there and reading body language. \",\n"," \"For me personally, I find it a lot harder to focus when I am at home. In college, I COULD NOT study in my dorm room; I always had to go to the library or Starbucks if I wanted to get things done. The same thing applies to this situation, except I don't really have anywhere to go. I have tried taking frequent breaks, turning off my phone, things like that, but I still don't think I am as focused as I would be in the bank. \",\n"," \"I am not able to focus as long while working virtually. I think the connections I'm making are not as strong as they could be due to virtual meetings rather than daily in-person interactions. I understand that these are barriers that inevitably come with working virtually and I appreciate all of the group meetings the coordinators have organized with senior leaders and our intern cohort.\",\n"," 'I am still able to get ',\n"," 'I believe I would be more productive at the bank. Being at home can have its distractions. I enjoy an environment where I can work with people in person. Also, our projects have required collaboration with a whiteboard. A virtual whiteboard is not very easy to work with.',\n"," 'I believe it is more challenging to connect with fellow employees and swap ideas on a consistent basis virtually, as opposed to working in-person. ',\n"," 'I believe working from home on a daily basis is less motivating and productive than working in person would be. It can also be distracting to work while surrounded by family members who are not in work mode.',\n"," \"I do miss some of the socializing that I believe there otherwise would be, and I tend to find it easier to network and connect with people when I can meet them face to face, but other than that, I'm really satisfied. I also do think that these issues are unavoidable. \",\n"," \"I feel I'm more productive virtually, as I'm just less distracted in my room, am more relaxed, and can work for longer periods of time. I still do miss the peer interaction of an in-person setting, though.\",\n"," 'I have had recent setbacks at home, and it can be challenging to focus',\n"," \"I have trouble staying focused for long periods of time, so working for eight hours straight can be pretty challenging for me. This past year, I went back to school in-person and I noticed that my ability to focus significantly improved, most likely because I had different environments, people around me, things to keep my mind occupied. Now, just sitting in my office for eight hours a day, there is no change of scenery, I'm not really seeing any people, and it's making me a bit burnt out\",\n"," 'I think I could make better connections if I were in person. ',\n"," 'I think it has helped with time management. For me it, it would take about an hour and a half of traveling to get to and from the bank each day. So while not seeing people is not as great, it has helped me do more with my free time. More in free time generally equals less stress and probably more focus during the workday. In addition, I can also structure my breaks a bit more personally. For example, during lunch break, I eat throughout the day so I usually finish pretty quickly (five-ten minutes). So I usually take a quiet ten-fifteen minute nap that reinvigorates me for the rest of the day. This would not be feasible in the workplace. I think the ideal work conditions going forward are a blend of virtual and in person attributes.',\n"," 'I think working in an office allows me to understand by projects better because I am able to show people what I am struggling with and working on in real time, and they are able to know exactly what my problem is. In the virtual environment, getting questions answered is delayed because you need to set up meetings or send an email. This delay makes me feel like my productivity is not what it could be if I was working in an office.',\n"," 'I think working virtually ha',\n"," 'I think working virtually has',\n"," 'I work better in office. Communication with others can happen more organically making networking easier. Ease of communication also makes getting direction easier. ',\n"," \"I'm not sure for better or for worse, but it's very different. Pros- I can hang out with our foster dogs during the day and I take breaks and run around outside with them, so I feel very refreshed and not like I'm in a traditional office. Cons- I feel a little more distracted and it's harder to talk with people quickly about projects (over Skype it's not the same, and we don't always have a meeting set). I do miss popping my head into people's cubicles/offices to ask questions.\",\n"," \"It has taught me to manage my time well and also realize that breaks are necessary for efficient work. I think society has taught us that we need to be working 100% of the time, but with virtual work, that is pretty impossible. It's important that we give ourselves short breaks to recharge.\",\n"," 'It is hard to stare at a computer all day with no in-person human interaction. Also, it is easy to lose track of time. I will work for hours straight without realizing it, when I should be taking breaks to stand.',\n"," 'It is more difficult to understand the workplace culture as well as to get to know other people at the Bank.',\n"," 'It makes it harder to network, although I am still meeting lots of people, it is harder to make those meaningful connections. I also think that my material would simply be easier to comprehend if I were in the office with my mentor and manager.',\n"," \"It's a double-edged sword. On one hand, being able to interact with people and just swing by a cubicle makes collaboration a fair bit easier, which is huge for in person work. On the other, I find it easier to get in the zone when remote. I'm not sure if I'm more efficient, but it feels like I might be. Honestly, I'd say I probably perform equally well under both conditions.\",\n"," \"It's been more challenging to network than it would be otherwise.\\n\\nThough it's certainly cheaper, I find myself disengaging from Teams meetings to work independently quite frequently which wouldn't be a temptation in person. \",\n"," \"It's definitely hard not to feel a little isolated through all of this, although I think the internship program does a good job of helping interns feel comfortable reaching out to others at the bank for networking and just getting to know them!\",\n"," \"It's harder to ask questions or get help. Now you have to reach out and set up a call or wait for an email response where before it'd be a quick question in person.\",\n"," \"It's harder to stay focus and harder to connect with people. Everyone is trying their hardest to make it the same experience, but it is the nature of a virtual environment. \",\n"," \"It's more difficult to make connections/network in a virtual environment\",\n"," \"I've found that not being around the people I'm working with makes me more distracted which can be bad for my productivity.\",\n"," 'Lack of time to make true connections with other interns. I have connected 1 on 1 with other interns, but still not the same as if we were sharing the same office completing tasks together. I feel like I would be busier or at least seem busier if I was in the bank. ',\n"," \"Often, it's tough to maintain focus when not in an office. I try and break up each day the best I can, but of course it's still difficult! I think this article in the Wall Street Journal characterizes a lot of the challenges of virtual internships, and it has some great recommendations: https://www.wsj.com/articles/interns-seek-solutions-to-isolation-during-the-summer-of-coronavirus-11594598400. For example, to add some variety to each day, I think it would be really great if we organized some (mandatory?) social events for all interns. Maybe small group coffee chats or a one-on-one random pairings with another intern every morning, could be fun. Events like those could help change focus for a little bit and add some more variety to the day, while also providing a great networking opportunity with other interns we haven't necessarily interacted with much.\",\n"," 'Slightly because I have to balance my home and work life.',\n"," 'The Bank has done an incredible job transitioning the internship to virtual, and I am so grateful that you did. I do think it is a little more difficult to make connections with other people/interns virtually, and this makes it harder to have casual conversations about our work, clarifications on something, etc. I would say working virtually has impacted my performance but not drastically so.',\n"," 'This virtual format has had a slight impact on my performance. While I am focused and prioritizing my work to the highest standard, I feel that there is a level of focus that I would have if I were to working at the bank. It is simply due to the nature of this virtual environment, and so far I have been able to adapt and be successful. ',\n"," \"Working remotely has, in my opinion, increased the time it took to get started with work.  Not being able to go over to someone's desk to ask a question creates a lag in communication, which is oftentimes inevitable in an online setting.  Once the getting-started period ended, productivity increased. \",\n"," \"Yes, I think it has. I have learned the importance of communication since I can't talk to the person face-to-face, and it's helped me see how time management is key. While I do think I'm more productive working in person, I've figured out ways to keep me motivated and on task.\",\n"," 'Yes, my internet is unreliable or too slow to maintain a video call.
